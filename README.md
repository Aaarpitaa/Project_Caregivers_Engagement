This study evaluated 250 caregivers in a randomized control trial (RCT) and their association with engagement

Introduction: Patients with chronic Heart failure (HF) undergo extensive treatments throughout their life. 
However, none of these treatments cure them completely for life. These patient needs caregivers constantly to support them throughout. 
The caregivers undergo a great deal of stress and often times have to go through coping mechanism to support their patients. 
After diagnosis and procedures, the lives of caregivers change drastically. This study was design to assess the efficacy of a
health coaching intervention to prove caregiverâ€™s self-care with 250 caregivers enrolled in a randomized control trial (RCT). 
Now, among them, 125 participant caregivers in the treatment group were selected to know what factors are associated with caregivers 
engagement with the study intervention, for that we looked at participant  (caregiver) level factors and zipcode level factors. 
At the beginning of the study it was found that participant level race and income were associated with engagement.  
As a result, we decided to investigate whether zip code level characteristics were also associated with engagement and 
participant characteristics.![image](https://github.com/Aaarpitaa/Project_Caregivers_Engagement/assets/132159165/e5c4daaf-b64c-42bd-af3b-fc288a41f4eb)
